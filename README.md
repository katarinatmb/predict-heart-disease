# predict-heart-disease
 This project applies machine learning to predict heart disease presence using clinical  and demographic data from the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The goal was to compare three distinct  machine learning approaches: a Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive  Bayes classifier.

### Predicting Heart Disease with Machine Learning: A Comparative Analysis of Neural Networks, SVM, and Naive Bayes 
Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for millions of 
deaths each year. Early detection and accurate risk assessment are critical for prevention and 
intervention. This project applies machine learning to predict heart disease presence using clinical 
and demographic data from the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. The goal was to compare three distinct 
machine learning approaches: a Neural Network, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naive 
Bayes classifier, to determine which model provides the most reliable and balanced predictions for 
clinical decision support. 

### Data Source

The dataset comes from Kaggle. It was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
